Solutions to some of the Project Euler problems

I really like [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) as a way to learn or practice a new language.  
In this repo are solutions to some of the project Euler problems solved recently.

Currently, there are nearly 650 problems on the website, with a range of difficulties.  
I've solved 90 so far, hoping to soon crack 100! 
If you start working on the problems too, and want to add me as a friend, use the friend key
